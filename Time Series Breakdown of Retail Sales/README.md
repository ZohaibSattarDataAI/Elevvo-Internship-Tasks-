# 📊 Time Series Breakdown of Retail Sales

This project is part of my **Elevvo Internship Tasks**, where I performed **Time Series Analysis** on the Walmart Sales Forecasting Dataset (Kaggle).  
The main goal of this project was to explore sales trends, moving averages, seasonal patterns, and revenue breakdown by product and region over time.
