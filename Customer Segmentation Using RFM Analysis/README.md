# 📊 Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis  

This project is part of my **Elevvo Internship Tasks**, where I performed **customer segmentation** using the **Online Retail Dataset (UCI)**.  
The goal of this project was to analyze customer behavior and suggest marketing strategies using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** model.

## 📌 Project Overview  
- 📂 **Dataset**: Online Retail Dataset (UCI)  
- 🎯 **Objective**: Analyze customer purchasing behavior and group them into segments based on RFM scores.  
- 🛠️ **Approach**:  
  1. **Recency** → How recently a customer made a purchase  
  2. **Frequency** → How often they made purchases  
  3. **Monetary** → How much money they spent  
  4. Assign RFM scores to each customer  
  5. Segment customers into groups (e.g., Loyal, Inactive, Big Spenders)  
  6. Suggest marketing actions for each group (discounts, re-engagement campaigns, etc.)

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries  
- **Programming Language**: Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Libraries**:  
  - pandas → data manipulation  
  - numpy → numerical analysis  
  - seaborn & matplotlib → visualizations  
  - datetime → recency calculations  

*(Alternatively, this analysis can also be performed in **Excel**.)*
