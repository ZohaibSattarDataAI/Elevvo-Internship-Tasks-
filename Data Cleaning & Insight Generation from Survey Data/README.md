# 🧹 Data Cleaning & Insight Generation from Survey Data
This project is part of my Elevvo Internship Tasks, where I worked with the **Kaggle Data Science Survey (2017–2021)** dataset.  
The goal of this project was to clean real-world survey data, handle categorical variables, and extract meaningful insights about respondent behavior and preferences.

## 📌 Project Overview
📂 **Dataset:** Kaggle Data Science Survey (2017–2021)  
🎯 **Objective:** Clean the dataset, standardize categorical values, and generate key insights about the data science community.  
🛠️ **Approach:**  
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting  
- Apply label encoding or mapping for categorical variables  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Extract **Top 5 insights** about respondents’ demographics, tools, and preferences  
- Create summary charts for reporting

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
**Programming Language:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)  

**Libraries Used:**  
- `pandas` → data manipulation  
- `numpy` → numerical analysis  
- `seaborn` & `matplotlib` → visualizations  
- `scikit-learn` → encoding categorical variables
